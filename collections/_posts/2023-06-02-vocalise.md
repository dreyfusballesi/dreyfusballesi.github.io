The *Vocalise* system gives users intricate control over a vocal synthesiser. The system aims to invoke the expressive qualities inherent in the human voice, while also enabling the user to access timbres, pitches, and effects which are beyond the ordinary capabilities of human vocal tracts. 

*Vocalise* draws inspiration from Yamaha's Vocaloid system. However, while Vocaloid uses a piano roll interface to control the rhythm, melody and lyrics of its output, *Vocalise* uses real-time, fine-grained inputs to control the sound. This facilitates a greater connection between the performer and the musical system, enabling more virtuosic expression in the context of live performance. The use of the gyroscope encourages the user to play *Vocalise* in an embodied way - expressing changes in pitch and tone through movements in their body. *Vocalise*'s interface is designed to be playable without looking at a screen, freeing the user to move as they wish without sacrificing crucial feedback from the interface.
