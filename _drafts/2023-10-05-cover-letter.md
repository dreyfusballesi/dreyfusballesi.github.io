Dear hiring manager,

As a graduate computer scientist and long-time Canva user, I am excited to apply for the position of Graduate Engineer at Canva. I am confident that I can add value to the Canva Engineering Team through my technical skill set, passion for creative code, and dedication to building inclusive communities.

### Object-Oriented Design
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have cultivated a versatile skill set, delving into a range of programming languages and software tools. I am well-versed in Object-Oriented programming, having used object-oriented design extensively throughout my degree. I have designed class diagrams for two video game projects, taking them from concept to implementation using Java, C#, and Unity.

### Coding Creatively
What truly fuels my passion is using technology as a conduit for creativity. Creative expression is at the heart of my portfolio of work, and I find my greatest motivation when working on projects that empower artistic ingenuity. Canva's mission to democratise design tools resonates deeply with my aspiration to facilitate creative expression through technology.

### Up the Vibe
Fostering vibrant and supportive communities is integral to both my professional and personal ethos. I enjoy working with people from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences in multidisciplinary teams. I also have a track record of initiating positive change in my community, from introducing yoga classes during my tenure at Ernst & Young to founding and growing the ANU Improv Society.

I would be gratful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Canva's ongoing success and innovation.

Kindest regards,
Kai Dreyfus-Ballesi
